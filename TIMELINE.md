## 🌟 What This Journey Taught Me

### 1. Failure is Fuel
Every collapse was a catalyst. Every breakdown was a breakthrough waiting to happen.

### 2. Speed Matters
- SPM in 1 year vs. 2 years: **2x velocity**
- STPM in 3 months vs. 18 months: **6x velocity**
- 100+ certifications in 2 years: **Unprecedented acceleration**

### 3. Resilience is Trainable
It's not about never falling. It's about the **recalibration speed** after impact.

### 4. Play Your Own Game
- Others played poker with luck
- I learned to play chess with strategy
- **Different game, different rules, better outcomes**
