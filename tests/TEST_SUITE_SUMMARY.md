# Test Suite Generation Summary

## Overview

This comprehensive test suite was generated to validate the changes made to SVG assets and GitHub Actions workflows in the current branch compared to `main`.

## Files Changed in Diff

Based on `git diff main..HEAD`, the following files were modified:

### Deleted Files (Badge JSON)
- `assets/badges/certifications.json`
- `assets/badges/domains.json`
- `assets/badges/learning.json`
- `assets/badges/partnerships.json`
- `assets/badges/status.json`

**Reason**: These files are now dynamically generated by GitHub Actions workflow instead of being static files.

### Modified SVG Files (Enhanced with Accessibility & Responsive Design)
- `assets/headers/certifications-header.svg`
- `assets/headers/persona-header.svg`
- `assets/headers/strategic-header.svg`
- `assets/headers/technical-header.svg`
- `assets/headers/timeline-header.svg`
- `metrics.svg`

**Key Changes**:
- Added `viewBox` for responsive scaling
- Added `role="img"` and `aria-label` for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Added `<title>` elements for screen readers
- Added responsive CSS media queries
- Used percentage-based positioning
