# 📖 PERSONA: The Transformation

---

## 🌅 The Foundation

I was born in **Pahang**, shaped by **Pasir Puteh** — a background that instilled a hard-wired sense that resources and chances are finite. That single lesson became my fuel, fostering a low tolerance for waste and an obsessive guard against complacency.

This isn't just philosophy. It's survival wisdom burned into my DNA.

---

## 🔥 The Crucible Years (2008-2014)

### The Fall
- School dropout
- No obvious path forward
- Had to rebuild from nothing

### The Rise
- **Mastered SPM in 1 year** — 5A, 1B, 4C
- **Completed STPM in 3 months** from scratch — CGPA 3.84 (4A, 1B)
- **University Sains Malaysia** — CGPA 3.26, Dean's List
- Learned that **learning velocity** matters more than credentials

**Key Insight:** Every failure was a data point. Every comeback was a recalibration.

## 🏗️ Construction Leadership (2015-2020)

### Lee Swee Construction
- **Site Supervisor** → **Senior Supervisor** → **Site Agent/Manager**
- Led 4 major projects (Metro Kajang Holdings, Ecoworld Bhd)
- Managed teams, budgets, timelines under extreme pressure

### What I Learned
- How to lead when there's no playbook
- How to make decisions when information is incomplete
- How to stay calm when everything is on fire
- **Execution is clarity under chaos**

This wasn't just construction. It was leadership forged in concrete and steel.

## 💼 Entrepreneurial Testing Ground (2020-2023)

### WMH Resources
- Founded and scaled to **3 online shops**
- Daily operations, supply chain, customer acquisition
- 2022: Maintained shop performance despite months of non-operation

### The 2023 Crisis
Then it all collapsed:
- **Cyber DOS attack** — Technical warfare
- **Relationship breakdown** — Personal crisis
- **Financial reset** — Zero to rebuild from

Most people would call this failure. I call it **the most valuable education I never paid for**.

**Critical Realization:** I needed to stop playing poker and start playing chess.

---

## 🚀 Technology Transformation (2023-Present)

### The Pivot
Made a conscious decision to leave everything behind. Not as retreat. As **calculated recalibration**.

I had to reverse-engineer my own obstacles:
- Playing chess in a world built for poker
- Building capital with no currency
- Making my own table when I wasn't offered a seat

### The Acceleration
- **100+ certifications** acquired in compressed timeframe
- **Google Partnership** — Individual, no organization backing
- **IBM Business Partner** — Strategic relationships built from zero
- **AWS Partnership** — Multi-cloud expertise demonstrated

### Domains Mastered
1. **AI/ML** — Google Gen AI Leader, IBM AI/ML, AWS ML
2. **Cybersecurity** — CEH v12, TryHackMe CTF, OSINT Expert
3. **Cloud Computing** — Google Cloud Professional, AWS Partner, Azure
4. **Digital Marketing** — Google DM Professional, HubSpot CRM
5. **Business Intelligence** — Strategic problem-solving frameworks

## 🧠 Who I Am Today

### Core Identity
I'm **not** just technical. I'm **not** just strategic.

I'm **transdisciplinary** — I operate across boundaries that most people accept as walls.

### What Drives Me
- **Mastery over complexity** — I'm frustrated by inefficiency, stagnation, and mediocrity
- **System thinking** — I see throughlines others miss
- **Translating chaos into clarity** — This is my superpower
- **Building real value** — If I climb alone, I've failed

### Operating Principles
- **Time is Currency** — I treat it like gold
- **Instructions are Contracts** — I don't make assumptions
- **Precision is my Mindset** — Not a habit, a way of being
- **Continuous Evolution** — Every scar makes me sharper, quieter, more effective

---

## 🎯 My Approach

I don't operate in silos. I see the **throughlines**.

I take complex systems, decode the chaos, and turn them into frameworks that actually move the needle.

Whether I'm:
- Optimizing tech stacks
- Rebuilding business models
- Architecting security infrastructure
- Engineering growth campaigns

I keep one rule: **If it doesn't serve real people, it's just noise.**

---

## 💭 Philosophy

> **"I don't talk about 'change' — I become it. When others freeze, I calculate, study the cracks, interrogate, and see the patterns."**

Right now, I'm exploring intersections where **creativity**, **innovation**, and **meaningful impact** converge.

I believe the future demands more than just skill — it requires:
- **Vision** — Seeing what others can't
- **Discipline** — Executing when it's hard
- **Emotional Intelligence** — Understanding the human element
- **Courage to Reinvent** — Breaking the script when it's broken

---

## 🌟 What Makes Me Different

1. **I don't keep up with change — I challenge it**
   - Instead of asking "How do I use this tool?"
   - I ask "How do I redefine what's possible with it?"

2. **I don't just execute — I interrogate**
   - Every solution is stress-tested
   - Every assumption is questioned
   - Every outcome is owned

3. **I don't climb alone — I build tables**
   - If my success doesn't create opportunities for others
   - Then it's not success

---

## 🔥 The Honest Truth

I'm **Hanis**.

Not perfect. Not polished. But **real**.

- I've failed more than most people ever dare to try
- I've rebuilt quieter, sharper, more intentional each time
- I don't regret a single scar — they made my thinking clearer

**Analytical. Reflective. Resilient.**

I act with intention. Plan with clarity. Execute with precision.

I describe myself simply:
- **Honest by principle**
- **Sharp by necessity**
- **Always evolving by design**

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaborations

Where **innovation**, **integrity**, and **meaningful impact** meet.

If you're building something that truly matters and need someone who:
- Breaks down walls when things get uncertain
- Thrives in complexity
- Works with precision
- Doesn't flinch when things get hard

**I'm the one you want beside you in the storm.**

Not for the spotlight. But for the aftermath. For the build. For the legacy.
